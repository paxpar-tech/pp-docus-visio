# git

We may use a simple git repo as Nuxt Studio source backend.

Currently Nuxt Studio uses github as its source backend.

We will lose a lot of feature specific to github.

This will open a lot of new usecases where github is not an option :
* full open source git forge (gitlab, ...)
* lightweight self hosted option (gitea, ...)
* sovereign hosting
* GAFAM/BATIX free hosting
* private hosting for security
* edge hosting for speed (huge git repo)
* lower price
* special free tier feature (gitlab private repo with public pages, ...)
