# runtime use

Use Nuxt Studio to edit live-content.

Think of a webapp where some pages fetch data from live sources (mostly YAML/JSONÂ§/MD file in a S3 bucket).

Being able to edit those sources with Nuxt Studio without a full or partial site generation (when [hybrid rendering](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering) is not an option).
