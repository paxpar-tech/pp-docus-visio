# S3 bucket

See also [S3 bucket for docus](/docus/s3).

We may use a S3 bucket as Nuxt Studio source backend.

Currently Nuxt Studio uses github as its source backend.

Editing files in Nuxt Studio will result in direct S3 file operations.

s3 is better than git for *live*  updates.

git is better than s3 for *traced*  updates.



TODO: Explore
the [nuxt sources configuration](https://content.nuxt.com/get-started/configuration#sources)
which is based on [unjs/unstorage](https://github.com/unjs/unstorage)
which support S3 backend.
