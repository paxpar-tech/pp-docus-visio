# escape key

While editing a file, pressing the escape key move up one level on editor/browser hierarchy.

In the editor this beheviour is misleading if you use mutiple cursors.
The common way to exit multiple cursors is also pressing the escape key.

To be sure to exit the multiple cursors, I tend to press the escape key even if I'm not in multiple cursor, resulting in exiting the editor.
