# Nuxt UI

Pending questions :

* For a nuxt layer distribution, do I need to put license key in the target repo ?
* For a webcomponent distribution, do I need to put license key in the target repo ?
* Does the Nuxt UI pro templates provides a pre-configured vitest test set ?
* Does the Nuxt UI pro templates provides a sample best-practices component we can use to start new component without any licensing issue ?
